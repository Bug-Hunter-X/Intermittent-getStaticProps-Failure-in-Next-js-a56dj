# Next.js getStaticProps Intermittent Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `getStaticProps` function in a Next.js application intermittently fails to execute during the build process. The problem is not consistently reproducible but has been observed under certain conditions (potentially related to network latency or build caching).  The solution provided addresses this by employing more robust error handling and ensuring reliable data fetching.

## Bug Description

The `getStaticProps` function, intended to fetch data and generate static pages at build time, sometimes fails to run properly. This leads to pages being rendered with incomplete or incorrect data, negatively affecting the application's functionality and user experience.

## Solution

The solution implements enhanced error handling within the `getStaticProps` function.  It includes retry mechanisms and fallback options to mitigate the issues caused by network problems or temporary API unavailability.  Additional logging is included for debugging purposes.
